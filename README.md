conditional VAE (CVAE), VQ-VAE + PixelCNN, VQ-VAE2 + Gated PixelCNN, cVAE-cGAN in tensorflow 2.x  
The dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2  

CVAE is based on: https://keras.io/examples/generative/vae/   
VQ-VAEs and PixelCNN are based on: https://keras.io/examples/generative/vq_vae/ and https://github.com/rosinality/vq-vae-2-pytorch  
Gated PixelCNN is based on: https://github.com/rogertrullo/Gated-PixelCNN-Pytorch  
cVAE-cGAN is based on https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomasdubail/vae-gan
